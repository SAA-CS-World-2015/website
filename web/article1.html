   <li>I'll leave that to the pastor. That's his type of work.</li>
             <li> I have no idea what to say.</li>
             <li> I let my actions spread the Word.</li>
             <li> I'm waiting for the right, perfectly timed moment.</li>
             <li> I'm not good with words.</li>

          <div id="Body2">
          <ul>
           <li> Ephesians 4:11,12 literally tells us that our spiritual leaders are tp equip us so that we may go out into the world and tell others about the same grace that has saved us </li>  
              <li> There are so many resources out there to guide and help us. Websites, planned events, spiritual leaders, and many other assets are right at our finger tips </li>
              <li> That's great but without sincere words there is a lack of substance. A person cant figure what your all about by just watching you. Your actions and words should work together. They make a powerful team </li>
              <li> There is no specific perfect time. Just jump into it! Obviously there are some times that arnt good to share. Just make sure the time is fairly appropiate.</li>
              <li> Read up on the story of Moses. He was not anywhere near a good speaker but with God he led an entire nation</li>
