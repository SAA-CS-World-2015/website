         <h3>Definition of family
         Relationship between bible and family</h3>
         <ol>
         here we would have a few paragraph about the definition of family and relationship between bible and family(like this::a basic social unit consisting of parents and their children, considered as a group, whether dwelling together or not.
           the word family have more than one meaning 1.a social unit consisting of one or more adults together with the children they care for(a single-parent family).
                                                      2.any group of persons closely related by blood, as parents, children, uncles, aunts, and cousins(a socially prominent family).
           when we use family(noun) to adjective,the meaning is of, relating to, or characteristic of a family. so the point is whatever we use the word family like adjective,noun,that meaning is related.
