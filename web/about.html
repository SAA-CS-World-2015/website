                <p><h4><center>This is a website created by two highschool students realizing the need for prayer and comfort. Praying on your own is a perfect way to talk to God one on one, but with others praying for you, you feel a sense of belonging and that people care for you and your problems. Prayer is a powerful way to solve your problems, its a beautiful way to connect with God, and it is a way you can be thankful for all the Lord has blessed you. This is the Prayer Box's mission, to bring you closer to God.</center></h4></p>
