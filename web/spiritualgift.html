                      <li>You love talking socially. You dont get the jitters when on stage and you have no fear of embarrasing yourself. You say whats on your mind and you say it so people understand it. You either make everything a joke to calm everyone down or you say things the way they are so people know what your talking about. If you relate to some of these your definitly a PREACHER!</li>
                      <li>You cant stand seeing someone getting bullied. When someone is crying you have to sit next to them and ask them whats wrong. Your strong emotionally so you dont cry alot yourself you usually bottle up your emotions to use them on others to help. You talk to them about God and read verses to help them feel better about life. If you realted to these you are most likely a COMFORTER!</li>
                      <li> You love helping others. But usually anonymously. You love getting gifts and usually dont expect anything in return. You give your time to help others whether its at a soup kitchen or a bible session. If you related to any of these your probably a GIVER! </li>
                      <li>You have a beautiful voice and love to sing. You love to sing Gods word and love to teach others around you. You have all the time in the world to give to him. You never miss church and try to be more like him everyday. If your like this you could possibly be a PRAISER!</li>
