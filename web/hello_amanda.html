    As divinely instructed by God, it is of one mind that we share the most direct interpretations ofthe Bible, praying for the ispiration of the Holy Spirit: the dove that hovers over the waters of baptism. As men and women upon this Earth our humanly natures hinder us from undying HAPPINESS, LOVE, and PEACE.By studying God's word, our hearts will no longer be lost the darkness of ignorance, but be refreshed with the Waters of Life(Jesus Christ). 
      We believe inthe Trinity (Father,Son,and Holy Spirit)
