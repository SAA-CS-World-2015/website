  <c2></c2> As divinely instructed by God, it is of one mind that we share the most direct interpretations of the Bible, praying for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (the dove that hovers over the waters of baptism). As men and women upon this Earth our humanly natures hinder us from undying HAPPINESS, LOVE, and PEACE. By studying God's word, our hearts will no longer be lost in the darkness of ignorance, but be refreshed with the Waters of Life. As with the woman at the well, Christ seeks to give us water so that we might never thirst again. The water of Life is drawn from the well of knowledge available to us in His word.</c2>
