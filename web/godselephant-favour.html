                    <p>We strive to make our audience love reading God's story. Our objective is to make everyone young and old yearn to have a connection with Jesus Christ, through His story.</p>
                        <p>2 Timothy 3:16-17 English Standard Version (ESV)
16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</p>
                    <p>What this Bible veres means to our company is that God's Word should be heard and practiced by everyone and is here to help us train ourselves to be more like Him. We hope to teach people the ways of our Heavenly Father, and lastly to help new believergrow stronger in their walk with Christ. To avoid temptation, get through trials and tribulation, and learn to depend on God no matter the circumstance. </p>
