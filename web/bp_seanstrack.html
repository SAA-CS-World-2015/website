                    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <h3>The Site Has Been Launched!</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to SDAgaming.com. Within the last few decades, technology has grown to the point of destroying our family life completly. Kids are caught up in games constantly, and there is so much out there that it is hard to know what is right. So what is right? This site is designed to answer that question. Developed by a teenager, who has experienced these problems firsthand, instead of the simple soulution of getting rid of "all fun", as many Christian kids say, we will decide what is right to play, and why we shouldn't play certain games.</p>
